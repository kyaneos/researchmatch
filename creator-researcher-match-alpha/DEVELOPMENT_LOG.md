# ResearchMatch Development Log

## Project Overview
ResearchMatch is a matching service that connects content creators with academic researchers to make research more accessible to the general public.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Frontend UI (Svelte + Vite)**
- ✅ Set up Svelte project with Vite
- ✅ Created main layout and navigation system
- ✅ Built 4 main pages:
  - **Home Page**: Landing page with featured creators and researchers
  - **Search Page**: AI-powered search interface with topic filtering
  - **Profile Page**: Editable user profiles for both creators and researchers
  - **Messages Page**: Real-time messaging interface for collaborations

### 2. **UI Components Created**
- `App.svelte` - Main application router
- `Nav.svelte` - Navigation component
- `Home.svelte` - Landing page with featured users
- `Search.svelte` - Search interface with filters
- `Profile.svelte` - User profile management
- `Messages.svelte` - Messaging interface

### 3. **Design Features**
- Clean, modern interface with responsive design
- Interactive components with hover effects
- Form validation and editing capabilities
- Topic tagging system
- Match scoring visualization
- Real-time messaging UI

## Planned Features (TODO)

### High Priority
1. Design the data model for users (creators and researchers)
2. Create JSON database structure for user storage
3. Implement AI-powered search functionality for topics/keywords

### Medium Priority
4. Build basic messaging system backend
5. Develop recommendation algorithm for matching
6. Create API endpoints for core functionality

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5.35.5 + Vite 7.0.4
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern design patterns
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Data Models (Planned)

### Content Creators
- name, bio, content_type (video/podcast/article)
- topics, platform, audience_size
- id, email, profile_image, created_at, interests[]

### Researchers
- name, institution, field, expertise
- publications, availability
- id, email, profile_image, created_at, interests[]

## Key Components Overview

### Search System
- Semantic matching using AI embeddings
- Keyword extraction from profiles
- Topic clustering for recommendations
- Filter by user type and topics

### Messaging System
- Inbox/outbox structure
- Connection requests
- Thread-based conversations
- Real-time updates

### Recommendation Engine
- Score matches based on:
  - Topic similarity
  - Engagement potential
  - Previous collaborations
  - Availability alignment

## Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Development Notes
- The application uses mock data for demonstration
- All UI components are fully functional
- Ready for backend integration
- Accessibility warnings in Profile component can be addressed in future updates

## Next Steps
1. Implement backend API with Node.js/Express
2. Set up database (start with JSON, migrate to PostgreSQL)
3. Integrate AI search using OpenAI embeddings
4. Add authentication system
5. Deploy to production environment
